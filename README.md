# Neural_network_and_deep_learning

• Making the code of Logistic model for the mental workloadclassification. You need to program from scratch by yourself. Python functions should be created separately for each step (e.g., forward propagation and gradient calculation). It is not allowed to directly use the command for Logistic model from a toolbox.
• Selecting a deep learning model for the mental workload classification. For the deep learning model, you can use any publicly available packages/toolboxes. It is very encouraging to adapt the existing deep learning models for the purposes of performance improvement. If you use publicly available code, you need to include proper references and explicitly state where the code is from in the report.
